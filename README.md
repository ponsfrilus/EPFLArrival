# EPFL Arrival

A Vue.js project for EPFL's newcomers.

This project serves two aims:
  1. Provide a user friendly website for newcomers to easily find services and
     resources they might need;
  2. Act as a discovery tools for EPFL employees.

For now, the site is available online on https://ponsfrilus.github.io/EPFLArrival/.
